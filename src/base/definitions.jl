Inner variables are used for keeping track of internal variables
of different dynamic devices. These are not states, since can be computed
algebraically using states and parameters, and are only used internally in each
component. In such case, it is possible to avoid creating dummy states that
must be added to the vector of states, by handling those as inner variables.
In some cases, depending on the complexity of the model, some inner vars are
also defined as states, but for the sake of generality are also added as inner
variables, since some models may not treat such variables as states.
